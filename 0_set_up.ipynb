    "There are two major package managers in Python: pip and conda. For this tutorial we will be using conda which, besides being a package manager is also useful as a version manager. There are two main ways to install conda: Anaconda and Miniconda. Any will be useful for this course, just follow instructions here, according to your operative system:\n",

    "In order to install tensorflow we recommend following the [official documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install). In your local machine, you will install the version that only has cpu support, but in Nabucodonosor you need to install the version with [GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu).\n",
